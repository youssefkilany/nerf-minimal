# NeRF from scratch

A minimal replication of NeRF Paper.

The dataset used is [Dishwasher](https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/dex-nerf-datasets/releases/download/corl2021/dex_nerf_real_dishwasher.zip) from [Datasets for Dex-NeRF](https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/dex-nerf-datasets). You'll find there more compatible datasets for experimentation.
